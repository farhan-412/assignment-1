            <p class="yunus-content">Muhammad Yunus (born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi economist, businessman, and politician who has been serving as Chief Adviser of the Interim Government of Bangladesh since 8 August 2024.Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance.Yunus has received several other national and international honors, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.
            Following the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina, President Mohammed Shahabuddin gave Yunus a mandate to form an interim government, acceding to calls from student leaders for his appointment. His government has appointed a Constitutional Reform Commission to draft a revision to the Constitution of Bangladesh and has pledged the convocation of a constituent assembly.[12] His name was listed in The 500 Most Influential Muslims in 2024.</p>
